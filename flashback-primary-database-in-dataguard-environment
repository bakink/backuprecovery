 Development wanted to do some changes in the dev database, which needs to be rolled back once testing is over.
So we have chosen to create flashback restore point before they do the changes and flashback the database, once testing is over.
Now there is a little twist. This is a data guard environment, i.e it has a standby database. Doing flashback on the primary database will break redo apply.
Below are the steps to flashback primary database in data guard environment safely.

1. Make sure both primary and standby database have flashback enabled.

-- PRIMARY DB

SQL> select name,database_role,flashback_on from v$database;

NAME DATABASE_ROLE FLASHBACK_ON
--------- ---------------- ------------------
PRIMDB PRIMARY YES

-- STANDBY DB

SQL> select name,database_role,flashback_on from v$database;

NAME DATABASE_ROLE FLASHBACK_ON
--------- ---------------- ------------------
STDBY PHYSICAL STANDBY YES

2. Create a restore point in the primary:[PRIMARY]

SQL> create restore point BEFORE_TEST GUARANTEE FLASHBACK DATABASE;

Restore point created.

SQL> select scn,NAME from v$restore_point;

SCN NAME
---------- -----------------------
14084750 BEFORE_TEST

Now we can confirm the dev team to do the changes in the primary database. And once dev team confirmed that their testing is over,
Follow below steps to flashback primary.


4. Shutdown Primary database [ PRIMARY]

SQL> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
Database closed.
Database dismounted.
ORACLE instance shut down.
5. Mount primary database [ PRIMARY]


SQL> startup mount
ORACLE instance started.

Total System Global Area 1.1107E+10 bytes
Fixed Size 7644464 bytes
Variable Size 9294584528 bytes
Database Buffers 1711276032 bytes
Redo Buffers 93011968 bytes
Database mounted.
6. Flashback primary database [ PRIMARY]

SQL> flashback database to restore point BEFORE_TEST;

Flashback complete.

7 . Open primary database in resetlogs: [ PRIMARY]

SQL> alter database open resetlogs;
Database altered.
8. Cancel the recovery on standby: [ STANDBY]

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;

9. Flashback standby database [ STANDBY]
Get the SCN value from point 2 (the respective scn of the guarantee restore point)

SQL>FLASHBACK STANDBY DATABASE TO 14084750;

Flashback complete.
10. Start recovery [ STANDBY]

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

Database altered
NOTE:
If you are getting below error in standby, then we need to recreate the control file in standby

Sequence 22 does not yet exist in new incarnation, and it has been already
applied in the old.
